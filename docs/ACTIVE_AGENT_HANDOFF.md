# Active Agent Handoff

Updated: 2026-07-18 HST
Owner: Codex
Status: validated

## Current Release Work

- Public branch: `agent/complete-studio-auth-release`
- Public scope: Google owner auth, magic email, Studio asset readiness, shared Neo4j projections,
  authenticated project mutations, local GPU routing, and multi-gate workboard approvals.
- Private Studio main: `0f5d526 integrate Studio SAGE civic and shared-agent release work`
- Private continuity: `AGENTS.md`, `config/ai_shared_work_state.json`, system awareness, and local-AI
  request context now make the active owner request mandatory reading for Claude, Codex, and local AI.

## Validation So Far

- Private Studio: 62 tests pass; changed Python compiles; changed JSON parses.
- Public focused release suite: 182 tests plus 5 subtests pass after integration with `main`.
- Public full suite: 256 tests plus 13 subtests pass.
- Docker Compose plans validate for govOS v2 and the standalone Studio asset service.
- The current Element Lotus WordPress bundle is regenerated and parity-checked against the public shell.

## Coordination Rule

Codex owns this integration until this file says `Status: shipped` or records a blocker. Other agents
may inspect and report findings, but should not rewrite the listed release surfaces or push this branch
without first recording a coordinated handoff.

## Next

Push the reconciled branch, open a fresh PR, wait for required checks, merge, then record the public
merge commit and final evidence in the shared private Studio state and dispatch log.
